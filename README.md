## My process
I started building out the skeleton layer the HTML and adding classes to the elements I wanted to stylized.
I used Affinity Designer to get the sizing of the elements.
Finailly put it all together with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

```css
  this-class { display: flex; }
```
Really helped solidify my knowledge of flex box.

### Continued development

I am going to continue on with learning gridbox as well as mobile responsiveness.
